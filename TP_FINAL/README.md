gcc *.c *.o -o game
```
Then run the program with the following command:

## Howt to play

This is the final project for the course "Algoritmos y Programaci√≥n I".

In this game, the player will be presented with a series of questions. Based on the answers provided, the game will determine the characteristics and abilities of the player's characte and the map where the game will take place.

The game will be played in a 2D grind, where the player will have to move around and interact with the environment.

The player will be able to move around the map using the following commands:

- `w` to move up
- `a` to move left
- `s` to move down
- `d` to move right
- `q` rotate the map to the left
- `e` rotate the map to the right
- `z` use the hammer 
- `c` use the extinguisher

The objective is to reach all the paperworks in the map avoiding the fire and the sockest.
